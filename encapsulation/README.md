# üõ°Ô∏è Encapsulation in Java vs Go

Encapsulation is about **protecting the internal state** of an object and **exposing behavior safely** through controlled access methods.

## üß† Concept Comparison

| Feature                  | Java                                  | Go                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Private fields           | `private` keyword                      | lowercase field name (package-private)   |
| Getters/Setters          | Explicit `getX()` and `setX()` methods | Exported methods (capitalized)           |
| Enforcement              | Strict access modifiers                | Package-based visibility                 |

## üîç Key Insight

- In Java, access is controlled via **public/private/protected** modifiers.
- In Go, any identifier that **starts with a capital letter is exported** ‚Äî everything else is package-private.
- Encapsulation is achieved in Go by keeping struct fields unexported and using exported methods for access.
