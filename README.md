# OOP: Java vs Go

This repository helps you understand core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using side-by-side examples in Java and Go. Go is not a classical OOP language but still uses many key ideas in its own minimal and composable way.

## 📚 Covered Topics

- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Encapsulation
- [x] Inheritance vs Composition
- [x] Polymorphism
- [x] Overloading vs Overriding
- [x] Constructors
- [x] Abstract class vs Interface
- [x] Access Modifiers
- [x] Static
- [x] Multiple Inheritance vs Multilevel
- [x] Composition & Aggregation

## 🛠️ Structure

Each folder contains:
- 📜 Java Code (classical OOP style)
- 🐹 Go Code (composition + interfaces)

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

This project started as a deep-dive learning journey into OOP after I first learned the concept. I wanted to truly **understand** OOP — not just memorize it. So I explored how Go takes a different route while still keeping the power of OOP through composition and interfaces.

## 🔥 Quotes that inspired this:

> “Inheritance is evil.” — Rob Pike (Go Creator)
