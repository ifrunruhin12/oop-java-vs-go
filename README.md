- [Static](./static)
- [Overriding vs Overloading](./overloading_vs_overriding)

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

This project started as a deep-dive learning journey into OOP after I first learned the concept. I wanted to truly **understand** OOP, not just memorize it. So I explored how Go takes a different route while still keeping the power of OOP through composition and interfaces.

## 🔥 Quotes that inspired this:

> “Inheritance is evil.” - Rob Pike (Go Creator)
